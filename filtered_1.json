So we\u2019re currently working on a game that makes extensive use of full motion video. Specifically, green-screened puppets.\n\nAs part of the game we wanted to layer some interaction on top of the video, which requires some kind of tracking the position of in-video objects and translating that position into Unity\u2019s world space. We\u2019re a team of 2 dealing with potentially hours of video, so I had to develop a fully automated process for doing so. Normally in special FX work, there\u2019s a partially automated process using trackers that then gets cleaned up with manual rotoscoping if needed.\n\nI started out by finding general object tracking tutorials and found this one here (<https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/>). This gave me most of the base code I needed, and the next step was just to tweak the color range and tracking to the source video I was working with. In our case, we were already using green for the background, so our tracking object was blue. Once I had that down, I exported the position data with timestamps to a binary file and set up the the corresponding read and position code in unity to align the positions with the video rendered in Unity.

    "text": "## What are some blockers with learning how to think in abstractions with code? Do people who take things literally have more problems with this than others?\n\nHonestly, it's just an experience thing. The opposite can be a problem (being unable to think literally), but comfort with abstractions comes from following certain steps long enough and giving a name to the pattern.\n\n## Talk more about topic ghettos\n\nTopic ghettos are when you group up a bunch of related things and teach them at the same time, but independently from how they're actually applied. In other words, teaching a gaggle of math concepts together is tidy, but if each of the math concepts are applied in wildly different ways it's difficult to create relevance with them.\n\n## How is coding is different than other kinds of skills?\n\nIt isn't. It has more in common with throwing a football, meditating, or dancing than it doesn't. A difference might be that it can be used to leverage so many other skills that it makes _them_ more valuable in the process, but it's acquired and developed in the same way.\n\n## Whats the best advice you'd give developers on searching for the right job? (Particularly when it's the 1st job out of school)?\n\nNetwork. Cold applications to job postings are fine and should be in your rotation too, but you have a much better chance going through someone you've met, in-person or virtually. In order of preference, companies generally hire for roles:\n\n1. Internally (\"We moved Sarah into that role\")\n2. Internal referral (\"Sarah recommended someone\")\n3. External referral (\"Sarah knows someone who recommended someone\")\n4. Closed external posting (eg. Denver Devs gigs post)\n5. Agency recruiter\n6. Open external posting (eg. Indeed)\n\nOne of the reasons you don't see a ton of \"Jr. Rails Engineers\" on public job boards is because it's so much easier to fill those jobs the other ways. Go meet some people.\n\n## Thoughts on the Lambda School scandal?\n\nThey are a garbage school run by Silicon Valley children, and they deserve the criticism they're getting. That said, a lot of the people criticizing them _also_ don't know shit about education and some of their critiques are completely invalid. For example, hiring your students isn't some cost savings measure or a way to pad the numbers. Even in Lambda's case, if every one of their 170 employees was a _currently enrolled_ student it would juice their garbo placement numbers _for only that class_ about 5%. People who recently learned something are a treasure in a classroom. Also \"teacher\" is one of the most common jobs in America. The chances of finding a dev who can teach their way out of a paper bag is pretty hard; the chances of finding a great teacher in a program for career changers is really high. I've hired tons of my students, and will continue to do so.\n\n## Can agile be used in teaching/learning?\n\nAbsolutely! My education teams work in day-long iterations, we plan each morning and retro each afternoon, we collect lots of data, and only do the highest priority things.",

The infrastructure is pretty mixed - they have Windows and Linux as well as Azure and AWS. Most of the applications are written in .Net and some Java. They are leveraging Docker Swarm, Kafka, Terraform and Prometheus. There is some legacy technologies - but 2020 is their year for digital transformation so there is a lot of opportunity here to make a big impact.\n\nThis role would be mostly managerial tasks - working with the engineers on their projects to get the best solutions and you will participate in code reviews. The ideal candidate would be an experience DevOps engineer that has recently been a manager.\n\nThe office is in Teterboro, New Jersey - but you only have to go into the office on Wednesdays. Occasionally there are other workshops on different days that you'd go in for.\n\nHow does this one sound?

I've felt it when start-ups think that hiring a young bootcamp grad for $80k/year would be able to contribute to my level _ever_, much less in the next few years. I've felt it when a CTO who hired me _almost didn't_ because he was afraid he couldn't manage someone with more experience than him. (And that was in my early 40s.) I've felt it even in Denver-area jobs that requested insane amounts of \"at home\" work to prove your skill -- something that a younger or unemployed developer might have time to do, but something that an older or _under-_employed developer wouldn't be able to complete.\n\n*But.* Demand for strong senior developers is high, and enough companies _don't_ fall into those traps that I haven't really had a hard time getting a job.\n\nSo does ageism exist? Absolutely. Does it exist to the point where a really strong developer (a really strong _male_ developer, at least) can't get a job? If so, I haven't hit that point yet.",

I have kind of taken a detour from the corporate ladder (bigger brands -&gt; more salaries -&gt; promotions) to focus more on real impact and things that matter (climate change being one). and of late I have been working with startups in this space. Before this, I have worked as a product manager and entrepreneur for over 4 years mostly in the travel and e-commerce industry, having worked on pretty much the entire product management spectrum. I have a formal education in Mechanical Engineering, Operations Research and Business Administration (all over the place, yaay!). Outside of travelling, I love reading, motorbikes (track racing/touring), cooking and doing headstands\nThere are infinite possibilities out there. Here to interact and collaborate to make the most of such possibilities :)",

Every tutorial I find says to look up the bot token in App Home - and sure enough it works when I do that. The question I have is where do I find bot tokens of other work spaces, because it is said that every work space that installs the app gets a different bot token? However I can't find any mention of where and when you get the bot tokens when installing the bot in other work spaces, only in my own (through the app home panel).\nAlso just wanted to say it's an awesome community you have here, Slack! Happy to be a part of it.",

I have tried numerous permutations of the configuration and looking this line:\n```(default_enabled_cops - enabled_cops).sort.each { |c| configs[c] ||= cop_configs[c] || {}; configs[c]['Enabled'] = false }```\nin <https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/blob/master/moduleroot/.rubocop.yml.erb>\nit reads: if a cop is in Rubocop\u2019s default enabled list but _not_ in the list for the selected profile - set it to disabled. There is no option to override this afaict. Am i wrong?",

Here you'll need to invest your time on regular basis and can expect surprises along the way.\n\nCandidate 2, will generally understand your expectations and will try and deliver within the scope outlined by you. The work may not spring many surprises and will be completed within set timeline.\n\nAlso, you'll need to align these candidates with senior designer you are hiring down the line.\n\nHope this helps in decision making process.\n\nBest",
