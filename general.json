So we\u2019re currently working on a game that makes extensive use of full motion video.

We\u2019re a team of 2 dealing with potentially hours of video, so I had to develop a fully automated process for doing so. Normally in special FX work, there\u2019s a partially automated process using trackers that then gets cleaned up with manual rotoscoping if needed.\n\nI started out by finding general object tracking tutorials and found this one here (<https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/>). This gave me most of the base code I needed, and the next step was just to tweak the color range and tracking to the source video I was working with. In our case, we were already using green for the background, so our tracking object was blue. Once I had that down, I exported the position data with timestamps to a binary file and set up the the corresponding read and position code in unity to align the positions with the video rendered in Unity.

It smelled  worse than rotting bread.\n  I'm sure the cause to why I fell ill immediately that night after inhaling it, my stomach hurled.. days having to run to bathroom,and  tummy has never been the same after that! I suddenly for years wasn't able to eat any tomatoes and tons of stuff I use to eat ..\n\nBut I'm finally able to most normal stuff again the past few years .. fixed it with probiotics and bunch of foods..\n\nDoesn't look like you have roaches and that might not be mold unless there's moisture trapped like pipe leaks.. but any dust sensitivities that could develop I which I knew about needing facemasks at that time!",

    "data": "## What are some blockers with learning how to think in abstractions with code? Do people who take things literally have more problems with this than others?\n\nHonestly, it's just an experience thing. The opposite can be a problem (being unable to think literally), but comfort with abstractions comes from following certain steps long enough and giving a name to the pattern.\n\n## Talk more about topic ghettos\n\nTopic ghettos are when you group up a bunch of related things and teach them at the same time, but independently from how they're actually applied. In other words, teaching a gaggle of math concepts together is tidy, but if each of the math concepts are applied in wildly different ways it's difficult to create relevance with them.\n\n## How is coding is different than other kinds of skills?\n\nIt isn't. It has more in common with throwing a football, meditating, or dancing than it doesn't. A difference might be that it can be used to leverage so many other skills that it makes _them_ more valuable in the process, but it's acquired and developed in the same way.\n\n## Whats the best advice you'd give developers on searching for the right job? (Particularly when it's the 1st job out of school)?\n\nNetwork. Cold applications to job postings are fine and should be in your rotation too, but you have a much better chance going through someone you've met, in-person or virtually. In order of preference, companies generally hire for roles:\n\n1. Internally (\"We moved Sarah into that role\")\n2. Internal referral (\"Sarah recommended someone\")\n3. External referral (\"Sarah knows someone who recommended someone\")\n4. Closed external posting (eg. Denver Devs gigs post)\n5. Agency recruiter\n6. Open external posting (eg. Indeed)\n\nOne of the reasons you don't see a ton of \"Jr. Rails Engineers\" on public job boards is because it's so much easier to fill those jobs the other ways. Go meet some people.\n\n## Thoughts on the Lambda School scandal?\n\nThey are a garbage school run by Silicon Valley children, and they deserve the criticism they're getting. That said, a lot of the people criticizing them _also_ don't know shit about education and some of their critiques are completely invalid. For example, hiring your students isn't some cost savings measure or a way to pad the numbers. Even in Lambda's case, if every one of their 170 employees was a _currently enrolled_ student it would juice their garbo placement numbers _for only that class_ about 5%. People who recently learned something are a treasure in a classroom. Also \"teacher\" is one of the most common jobs in America. The chances of finding a dev who can teach their way out of a paper bag is pretty hard; the chances of finding a great teacher in a program for career changers is really high. I've hired tons of my students, and will continue to do so.\n\n## Can agile be used in teaching/learning?\n\nAbsolutely! My education teams work in day-long iterations, we plan each morning and retro each afternoon, we collect lots of data, and only do the highest priority things.",

I've felt it when start-ups think that hiring a young bootcamp grad for $80k/year would be able to contribute to my level _ever_, much less in the next few years. I've felt it when a CTO who hired me _almost didn't_ because he was afraid he couldn't manage someone with more experience than him. (And that was in my early 40s.) I've felt it even in Denver-area jobs that requested insane amounts of \"at home\" work to prove your skill -- something that a younger or unemployed developer might have time to do, but something that an older or _under-_employed developer wouldn't be able to complete.\n\n*But.* Demand for strong senior developers is high, and enough companies _don't_ fall into those traps that I haven't really had a hard time getting a job.\n\nSo does ageism exist?

I love macadmins for the collective wisdom, but it's full of engineers. Engineers are often not able to zoom out and look at the bigger picture outside of their own situation/environment.

This should give you an idea of if the position is something you want to do. For #2....I read a lot of newsletters to stay up on what is going on in the broader tech landscape.

But what if any developer could build and prototype a sophisticated and functional AI-powered application as quickly and efficiently as they could launch a new webpage on Wix or Squarespace? This would be a game-changer in the world of AI, and it's exactly what Baha Abu Nojaim is going to show.\u00a0\n\nThe second session is \"Deep Learning Model to Detect Fraudulent Attacks\".\nIt will be presented by Nicola Corradi, Deep Learning Research Engineer at DataVisor.\nFraudulent attacks such as application fraud, fake reviews, and promotion abuse have to automate the generation of user content to scale; this creates latent patterns shared among the coordinated malicious accounts. Nicola Corradi digs into a deep learning model to detect such patterns for the identification of coordinated content abuse attacks on social, e-commerce, financial platforms, and more.\n\nDate: January 21\nTime: 1:00 pm - 2:30 pm EST\nTo access this webinar, please register here: <https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/4553680586730542093|https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/4553680586730542093>",

Your focus should be on what your customer cohorts are telling you, where your metrics can be improved. Then you take that question and you present it to the team. You then define the metrics of how to measure what you want to improve and only then find features that would work for it. This means you don\u2019t focus on the feature, but on fixing a real issue in your funnel. The feature is not the goal here. You then use a prototype if possible to test this, iterate on it, then if the results are good - send to development, if not, go back to the drawing board. Tools used are not that important, although I personally do not like confluence.\n\nWrite down what you are trying to solve. Write down the current percentages of users that convert in that specific funnel. Write down your results and use this for further iteration.\n\nFormal training doesn\u2019t matter as much as being constantly curious and not getting driven by vanity metrics. Look at actionable metrics, do cohorts and move away from totals (unless the business is purely a 1-off transaction).",

    "data": "Hey guys!\n\nFirst off, just wanna say that the Feather.js docs are fantastic; thank you for making easy-to-understand with clean formatting! Most of my background is front-end, so it helps to have solid documentation as I start my journey into the world of back-end. I recently picked up a job at a health tech startup as a front-end dev, but since I'm the only dev they can afford at the moment, it looks like I'm getting the opportunity to transition into full-stack. I'm pumped to fill in the gaps in my understanding (while being paid too)!\n\nAs a total noob to back-end, I've been considering what the best stack/solution is for our needs, and I'd *really* appreciate any validation on whether Feather.js is the tool for the job here.\n\nOur startup is developing hardware designed to deliver real-time feedback to physical therapy patients as they perform exercises. The idea is to stream data to a front-end app (React/React Native) via Bluetooth, then ship that to the cloud for analysis (we have a full-time data scientist who's working on Python scripts for live analysis), then back to the front-end so that the end-user can receive real-time feedback. They're also opting for Google Cloud over AWS, but that's w/e since Feather.js can go anywhere.  In a nutshell, the overall data flow looks like this (I think):\n\n```Bluetooth Device ~&gt; Front-End ~&gt; Node.js App ~&gt; Google Cloud Function (Python Scripts) ~&gt; Node.js App ~&gt; Front-End```\nI stumbled across Feather as a solution to build out the Node.js app as a means of streaming data from and back to the front-end (as opposed to straight Express + <http://Socket.io|Socket.io>). I've also read that implementing a Pub/Sub messenging system to hand-off data to and from the Cloud Function is a viable option as well, but I'm still figuring out what might work best for our use case. In your experience, does building out a Node app w/ Feather sound like the way to go?\n\nAnyway, apologies for slapping a chunk of text in this channel!  Thanks a ton in advance by the way, I'm a touch lost/overwhelmed trying to learn all this at once, but I'm having fun at the same time.",

However, it has also been my experience that the bootcamps are not enough, just like a two-year degree often isn't enough. It's barely scratching the surface, and if a person wants a job after a bootcamp (or two year degree), they need additional, demonstrable skills in full-stack web development and people skills- communication, attention to detail, etc. Coursework alone isn't enough, but it can help provide a basic foundation.

Someone manufactured it, someone supports it, someone designed it, and someone uses it to pulverize concrete.  Everyone is needed, in some way to pulverize the concrete.  I can\u2019t imagine the person who designed and manufactured the jackhammer thinks much about the person using the tool, outside of a design standpoint.\n\nSo I wonder, what is it?\n\nIs it intimidation?  that someone with a few months of learning is giving your 4 year CS degree a run for its money?  And if so, are you living up to your own expectations?\n\nWas it a bad experience?  that someone got over on you and that candidate was so terrible?

And no, I am not saying that just trying a bootcamp exempts anyone from having any sort of technical skill.\n\nBottom line, everyone in a bootcamp looks up to you and we just want to learn.  I haven\u2019t been on a dev team yet but hope the relationship between teammates is closer to a good neighbor than an unapproving parent. We know what we are up against and the stigma associated with us and we are still trying.\n\nI would just ask to look for the unquantifiable aspects of a bootcamp candidate next time they can\u2019t answer an algorithm problem, because they will learn it, just like you did.",

While MicroPython is a super slim version of Python, the reason it's slim is because it's designed to run on microcontrollers. Hence, the conversation in a MicroPython channel would include a lot of electronics talk, which would be off-topic for <#CA3TPAJAZ|python>. Creating a channel early would allow us to publicly archive resources and discussions on the topic, isolated from the pure Python side of things.\n\nWhile <#CA3TPAJAZ|python> isn't super active, I think that's likely a discoverability problem, considering how popular Python is as a language. That's also why I was wondering about a standardized format for finding language-specific channels on accident rather than on purpose. Devs are going to look for a place to talk shop and will get pointed to <#C3HTZPR08|dev>. When they search for <#C3HTZPR08|dev>, I think it would be awesome if they were suddenly faced with a list of topic-specific channels that they may be further interested in.

So there is significant risk from an employer perspective on hiring junior developers\u2014jr devs are usually not very productive for 3/6/12 months and further they may not work out at all.\n\nIdeally, your son would be able to demonstrate aptitude, passion, and commitment.  Logging 20, 40, etc hours of self-study prior to a code bootcamp would be something quantifiable that he could point to (in addition to solidifying his own interest and desire to move forward).\n\n\nFWIW I don\u2019t think there is a high degree of correlation between musicians and devs.  I know a lot of devs that aren\u2019t and a lot that are.  I do think it\u2019s a creative pursuit but also one that involves a significant amount of struggle, grind, and problem-solving.  If I had to pick a predictor, I\u2019d probably say woodworking but even that has to be fairly low.  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af   I think he should definitely give it a shot, but only move forward once he\u2019s put in a bit of effort.

    "data": "I won't consider someone without a college degree unless they have excellent experience, personally. It doesn't have to be Computer Science but I want to see a degree on the resume. I know it's anecdotal, but it is what I have observed: People with degrees tend to do better. I always stalk the person online, look at soft skills, like musical ability and outside interests. T shaped people. Make sure there isn't anything untoward on your social media before you start applying.\n\nI have heard of the programmer / musician correlation, and I've noticed it myself. There are A LOT of musicians who are also programmers. Programming is a bit like music in that you have to just sit down and do it for hours to really learn, which is similar to how a musician learns (practice).\n\nThe main thing I get out of seeing a code bootcamp on a resume is that the person is serious about moving into software development. Entry level 1s are extremely competitive. If I am hiring an entry level dev, I would probably choose one of my friends who is looking to transition careers over a stranger.  This means you have to network HARD and convince someone to train you from 0.  I think the best thing about being a musician is the ability to network and connect with people over a common hobby.\n\nI consider recent grads \"in training\" for a good year after being hired. There is just so much to train up and teach them.\n\nMost working programmers still have a CS degree. I consider my CS degree the best decision I ever made. I would probably take a 30 year old bootcamp grad with some unrelated work experience over a 22 year old CS grad who is going to jump ship as soon as possible.\n\nI do think code schools are valuable. There is a: \"I don't need a mentor, I can just teach myself with blog posts online!\" attitude that I consider bullshit. Having a teacher is so valuable. I say this as someone who is extremely autodidactic and reads piles of books every year. It is HARD to teach yourself something, especially when a lot of programming is toilsome ( setting up your dev environments, anyone? ).\n\nI agree with what other people have said, that you shouldn't go in from 0, because you can get a great running start in the basics of programming which are extremely simple and can be taught as a video game.\n\nMy advice to a beginning programmer would be:\n* Time in seat is important, but don't just flail around forever.\n* Code is extremely malleable and you can bend it into horrible shapes. Does a carpenter just cut wood into random shapes as they go along?  No. there are known woodworking techniques and re-inventing the entire professon of carpentry because you can't be arsed to read a book or watch some lessons or find a mentor is madness. So why would you try to do that with software development?\n* Learn to read programming textbooks and read the hits ( Mythical man month, Code Complete, Pragmatic Programmer).\n* We are all imposters so don't doubt yourself, you are probably doing fine.",

I have seen that a good chunk of graduates from these programs have their very first introduction to programming and development in the bootcamp, which is a poor way to start out (day 1 of the camp should not be the first time you write code); aside from being a big risk to your investment, there isn't much to differentiate you at the end - you can bet that if I'm reading your resume I'm also reading resumes from a number of people in the same cohort who will be working on very similar projects. Undoubtedly before attending a camp, get a month pass at codecademy or lynda and do a couple of starter/toy projects - your Github account (which will absolutely be looked at) will look a lot stronger.\n\nI've also been disappointed at how many camps manage expectations of the students - some are well grounded but I've met a lot of grads with unreasonable expectations for placement and salary afterwards. Entry level 1s can be tough to land initially; there's a lot of competition and not all companies are in a place where they can hire non-senior people, startups in particular where there aren't enough resources or mentors to do a entry level hire justice. I will say that experience outside of software is great - companies working in those fields need domain experience and the software/domain combo is hard to find.\n\nAdditionally, your son should try to get a feel for the non-technical side of the industry; how companies are structured, how a dev team works, etc. The seminal work Peopleware is great for that, local meetups and talks are also a great way to learn about processes that are necessary for shipping product but you won't have time to get to in a bootcamp",

We developed secure payments inside Slack via Stripe, feedback mechanisms, and more.\n\nWith Botkit-Mock, I required Gratify to be test-driven. At the time, there was no way to test Botkit conversations. Botkit-Mock enabled offline bot conversation testing written in mocha/jasmine.\n\nI really want to do my homie/partner right, and although I\u2019m sad we can\u2019t hire him full time, I\u2019d rather see him matched up with a company who can help him fulfill his personal goals (move to the US and work on a fulfilling project).

Step one in our journey toward mitigating climate change is inspecting wind turbines. We have inspected tens-of-thousands of wind turbines using fully autonomous drones which allow us to identify latent issues that might cause those turbines to fail. We use that damage data to help windfarm owners understand the health of their fleet and work proactively to maintain it, which in turn enables their fleet to operate more efficiently for longer.\n\n3 years ago, we were the first business in the world to offer this type of autonomous turbine inspection. Since then, SkySpecs has inspected over 30,000 wind turbines at 750+ wind farms in 19 countries on 5 continents. From the Australian Outback to the middle of the North Sea and everything in between.

Our Product Managers spend a bulk of their time talking with customers and understanding where we should be headed while our Web Engineers spend a bulk of their time writing code and working through technical problems. We're looking for someone to fill the space between to make sure that requirements are clear, constraints are understood, and that the process building a better product is smooth. You don't need to have been a web engineer to succeed in this role, but you do need to have some understanding of how modern web applications are built and what kinds of challenges are common.\n\nPlease reach out if this interests you! And if you read the 1 description and aren't sure that this would be the right role for you, but would be excited to work with us, reach out to me anyways!

    "data": "I was sliding down this opinion on Agile until last year when we made a change to adopt the Spotify model. We\u2019re a little on the small side for it, and while there were bumps in the road, we\u2019re in the groove now and continuing to adapt. We have two dev squads, one uses Scrum and uses it well. The other uses Kanban loosely and it is working. We\u2019re making adjustments regularly, but the adjustments are made in response to shortcomings in how we were working and not in how we\u2019re meeting other\u2019s definitions of how we should be working. Since I am in (and manage the devs in the squad) that is loosely Kanban, I will only speak of it. <@U73P7G2RJ> is correct in that none of those keywords are mentioned in the Manifesto, but reality dictates some concessions to the business. In our squad, we do not use story points. Instead, we slice the stories down. We are a cross functional squad (each dev supports a front end platform and some now, and all later, will also support the back end.) But we do use Jira and we talk of velocity and we make estimated delivery dates for CR\u2019s (which apply to the entirety of the squad encompassing work on all the platforms), but so far, the spirit of these just being long range forecasts not commitments has been honored. Of course, so far, all involved is in the Product Team, so preaching to the choir. And while I disagree with <@U0XRYGPM5>\u2019s assertion that Agile is BS, I totes agree with the best way to get stuff done is to hire great people who align with the organization and are hungry to get stuff done and humble enough.  In the end, a great team will get stuff done. I think a great agile team (in a wider agile department, and ideally company (a guy can dream, no?)) can do more, faster. But the key is not scrum, story points, or Jira. It is having the Agile Mindset from top to bottom.",

I think it is indeed possible and will take $20T in GDP growth from majority world countries. How can we go beyond \u201cGuns, Germs, and Steel\u201d and \u201cPoor Economics\u201d and look at things from a more entrepreneurial / design perspective?\n\nThis article covers topics such as industry-driven conditional cash transfer for talent creation, majority world workforce development, and diverse globally distributed teams. I think that high tech industries\u2019 demand for talent, rising global internet access (60%), and underutilized online learning material make a particularly interesting industry-driven development possible.

I was able to work on front-end and back-end with one language.\nNot much later we realized node.js wasn\u2019t up to the job for us, so leadership decided to move to Python for the back-end. I had to learn Python because much of my work was on the back-end\nThen we wanted an app so we hired a freelance iOS dev which didn\u2019t quite pan out as planned.\nI was interested in iOS so I was able to learn it and move from working on our back-end + website to focussing on building the iOS app and the rest is history :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nMost time in my career has been spent adapting, evolving and learning new stuff.

Conceptualizing differences in screen sizes, storage spaces, and processor speed is easy for me, because the differences are obvious. I get the basics of RAM quantity differences; more memory means less paging, and I have a sense of how much stuff open you can fill in 8gb vs 16gb vs 32gb. What I don\u2019t really know is how much the limitations of low RAM is felt, and how to conceptualize 16gb vs 32gb in practice. What practical impact do different quantities actually have on iOS development? What about graphic design or video editing? What might the situation look like 3-5 years from now? What would it take to make the 16gb to 32gb upgrade ($400) actually worth it?",

    "data": "This is a question that needs more space than a slack message to answer properly.  There are lots of books out there that try to answer this question, and many different takes.  I think the quick take away would be that you *can* maintain a healthy work-life balance. That balance will look different for everyone, and will change throughout your life.  At some points in your life a strict 9-5 or even less will be what you need / want to be healthy. At other points you may actually find yourself wanting to work longer and be completely happy and healthy. There are great companies out there, but there are also companies that *do not* foster a healthy balance, so half the battle starts in the job search and making sure you do your research.   When it comes to actual strategies, I think setting working boundaries is important, making sure you fight to block off deep work blocks in your day, where you minimize all distractions and get work done.  Organize and prioritize your work so you can see exactly what you are accomplishing and what needs done, and what can be put off without feeling guilty.  As mentioned above, commutes can be a big time drain, if you can't avoid them then use that time for some purpose.  Read, listen to audio books etc.  Block out parts of your day where you do things for yourself. Try to align your hardest tasks to the time of the day where you are generally most productive.  For me I do all my heavy thinking tasks in the morning, and leave the end of the day for smaller tasks, catching up on emails, planning out the next day etc.   Use your vacation time, preferably for _vacations_.  Life happens, so you will want to reserve some time off for the unexpected, but planning fun activities can help you live in the present and revitalize yourself.  Do personal retrospectives.  At the end of a large project / quarter / season /year.  Reflect on what went well, what stressed you out, ways you could reduce that stress in the future, things you want to do in the next time segment.  The person you were even 2 months ago is not going to be the person you are today, so you want to be mindful of that and iterate on your goals and how you spend your time.  Lay out some direction of what you want to accomplish medium - long term, and what things you need to do to get there.   Working hard or long hours is a lot easier and feels better when you know you are working _towards_ something, rather than just working.  Be an advocate for yourself.  It is ok to say no to unreasonable requests at work.  At times, yes, you will be asked to go above and beyond for something.  But the key is to make sure that the exception, not the rule.  That can take a bit of self advocacy and finesse in some situations, but if it truly isn't possible at your company then you should probably start looking for a new job.  Be proactive about your professional development, and do it in ways that interest you.  In CS you will need to always be learning new things, but do it in ways that you find engaging and interesting.       - I think that's all for now :joy:",

The biggest difference between these and BotKit are that the SDKs are focused on building for Slack, while BotKit supports many different communication apps. If you\u2019re building only for Slack, we think our SDKs offer more simplicity and evolve with the Slack APIs more directly.",

I live just north of the city and have found lots of good culture and food around. I know that it is definitely more diverse in the south suburbs. If you like Pho the best I have ever had is at Pho Duy in the south burbs.\n\nAs far as parties go, I feel like you can find something that fits your vibe if you know where to look. For me, I am huge into music and can find a good show almost any night of the week. If you are into beer we have so many breweries and fun bars all over the front range.

    "data": "<@URYPC863U> I've recently been applying for exclusively remote jobs. In the end, I ended up signing for a company whose head office is in the same country as me (UK), but I did interview with several companies based in other countries (mostly the US). I did some research and asked questions of employers I interviewed with, so will share what I learned:\n\n1. Usually if the company is based in a different country to you and they don't have a subsiduary in your country, you will invoice them every month for your hours and they'll pay you. Generally they'll agree a salary in _their_ local currency not _yours_ so your salary will fluctuate with the currency markets which may work for you or against you. Its up to you to sort out your own tax affairs. You are very unlikely to get any of the same benefits (e.g: health, pensions, etc) that employees get who live in the same country as the company's head office. Bear all of those things in mind when negotiating.\n2. Personally I've been applying for fairly mid-level (job title \"developer\" or \"senior developer\") jobs. I didn't have a lot of problems with getting interviews, but I already have a few years of experience working remotely which I think helped a lot. My instinct is that you may find fewer junior remote positions but I wasn't really looking for them. For mid-level positions, what they're really looking for is the ability to work independently without too much direction. If you don't have remote experience, focus on providing examples of how you have worked in a self-directing way in your application/interview. All that said, we've employed a couple of quite junior (non-technical) staff remotely at my current work and it worked totally fine, so.. meh :shrug:\n3. I got my new job from a cold online application and have interviewed for several others recently on the same basis. My first remote job came via an existing connection. You don't _need_ a referral/connection, but y'know.. it always helps.\n\nThe other thing to bear in mind is that if you're applying for remote jobs (especially if the company is accepting applications worldwide) there's a _lot_ of competition. As an applicant, you're competing in a much larger talent pool than your are with employers who only recruit locally. There are many more great developers in the world than there are in your city. Expect to get knocked back a lot, but the flipside of this is you have a much larger pool of employers you can apply to than if you were looking locally so make that tradeoff work for you.",

The working title for this panel is \"First Gen Students: Where are they now?\" I would like there to be 2-3 other people on the panel with me and it would be nice to have a moderator. Since the conference is for people of color I am looking for panelists/moderator who are people of color. It would be great to have someone that attended college outside of CS/STEM major but ended up in computing, someone who obtained their PhD as a first generation college student, and/or someone who attended college for a CS/STEM degree and is not currently an engineer but working in the tech industry doing something they love. Every panelist should be the first to attend college in their family meaning their immediate family that could assist them through college did not attend college themselves. For instance, my parents, grandparents, and aunts/uncles didn't attend. My hope is to share with students, faculty, and those that attend Tapia experiences being a first generation college student and that there are still some things even after college that we needed to figure out. I also want to highlight the different paths and decisions we all made and show various options that current students probably would not have been exposed to otherwise as first gen. In my case, I only wanted to be a doctor because that is what I saw most and thought was accessible and even after changing my major to CS, I pursued grad school instead. I still didn't think the tech industry was for me or what opportunities existed there so I imagine there are other students in the same boat.

I worked on an iOS app (Swift, not NativeScript) which needed to be able to have 100% functionality off-line. It was an inspection tool for heavy equipment such as things with undercarriage/tracks and large mining buckets with parts that wear rapidly. And the users would often be in a remote location, or down in a mine, while using the app. So we had to effectively pre-load an entire copy of data on the device. Any CRUD operations also had to be stored. Any actions which had a back-end counterpart would be cached in a local database on the device. The next time the device had a connection, it would perform all of the API calls in a FIFO manner. This meant essentially building a local version of any API calls the app relied on. The app would ALWAYS call the local versions. It didn't need to know/care if we were online. The endpoints would figure that out and either turn around and call the API or queue the requests locally. We used realm for that. But, if I were to attempt something similar in NativeScript, I'd probably use SQLite as it's platform-agnostic. Firebase looks like a good option as well, although I haven't personally used it [yet].",

It presents a back-of-the-envelope argument for *what exactly it would take to end world poverty and racial power imbalance in 1 generation* at macroscopic scale. I think it is indeed possible and will take $20T in GDP growth from majority world countries. How can we go beyond \u201cGuns, Germs, and Steel\u201d and \u201cPoor Economics\u201d and look at things from a more entrepreneurial / design perspective?\n\nThis article covers topics such as industry-driven conditional cash transfer for talent creation, majority world workforce development, and diverse globally distributed teams. I think that high tech industries\u2019 demand for talent, rising global internet access (60%), and underutilized online learning material make a particularly interesting industry-driven development possible. I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and feedback even if you take just a brief skim of the listicle\u2019s bullet points.\n\n<https://blog.learningdollars.com/2019/11/17/how-to-end-world-poverty-and-racial-power-imbalance-in-1-generation/>",

No egos and a leadership team that really cares about their team. The team has to be over 100+ people by now. HQ is in Vancouver, but Toronto is growing really fast.\n\nOur needs are always changing, but right now we\u2019re looking for a few intermediate to senior React developers. At the moment most of these roles are contract, but may be open to fill full-time roles as well. Some of these may be partially off-site, as we\u2019re putting together a \u201cblack ops style special unit\u201d for a very interesting client project. If you know any BA, QAs, PMs, or Product Strategy people, also looking to fill those roles as well.\n\nI don\u2019t feel our current website does Apply justice. We\u2019ve worked with some incredible companies of all sizes: Disney, EA, AGI, Freedom Mobile, Arc\u2019teryx, Tractor, Evo. I could hype up all the reasons why Apply is so great, but after six months I can safely say it\u2019s been one of my career highlights. Lots of snacks, lots of food, and likely the best tech outings I\u2019ve ever been a part of... next week is a curling bonspiel!!

I'm looking for the best way to read a characteristic (BLE) that in this case, has streaming data (yes, I know it can only emit packets of 20 on BLE 4). The data will mostly be 0's which I will ignore, but at some point a tag byte (0xFF let's say) hits the stream, then after that, the next 15 bytes has significance. It could return to more 0's after or be another tag byte (0xFF) to signify the start of another 15 bytes of valid data.  Now, when the connection is established and the app starts to read, it has no way to know if the stream being omitted by the BLE device is in the middle of a packet or not. The only thing we know is that there won't be a tag within the packet...only at the beginning of one.  So, it's basically a process of read...read....read until we see a 0xFF, grab the next 15 bytes, process it, then start again...read read read....  Thoughts?",
